Once upon a time, deep in an ancient jungle,
there lived a {0}.  This {0}
liked to eat {1}, but the jungle had
very little {1} to offer.  One day, an
explorer found the {0} and discovered
it liked {1}.  The explorer took the
{1} back to {2}, where it could
eat as much {1} as it wanted.  However,
the {0} became homesick, so the
explorer brought it back to the jungle,
leaving a large supply of {1}.
