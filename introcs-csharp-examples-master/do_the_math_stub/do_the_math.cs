         Convert this text into int numerator using
         int.Parse().

         Do the same for the denominator.

         Calculate quotient and remainder (as integers)
         Use Console.WriteLine() to display the labels
         as illustrated in the sample output in the lab.

         Do the same but using floating point division
         and not doing the remainder calculation.

         Create the sentence with the mixed fraction.
         Be careful of the places there are *not* spaces.
